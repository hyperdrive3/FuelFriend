A project to explore energy conservation in the grand scheme of "The Internet of Things".

Here, I am developing an android application utilizing API Level 21, developed purely on my personal smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S4 with the latest provider updates.

Mostly for own personal growth, taught myself a lot of lessons on android development :)

Note: Currently not being maintained.
